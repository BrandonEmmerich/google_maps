# Google Places

Collect and parse data from the google map api for any retail outlet in the united states.

For example, use this program to plot competitor proximity curves - the % of retail storefronts that operate without a competitor within N meters.

### Getting Started

From the command line, run `python zip_codes.py` to collect and store a list of all zip codes in the US, along with their corresponding GPS coordinates.

To collect storefront location data for Chipotle, from the command line run `python google_maps.py chipotle`.
